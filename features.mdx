    C --> D[Compare Diffs]

  ````bash
  pragma versions list --doc-id=123

| Global Search | Query titles and content | `project setup` |
| Folders | Nest documents hierarchically | `/api/reference/` |
| Tags | Categorize for quick filtering | `#feature`, `#bugfix` |

  Use operators like `AND`, `OR`, `"exact phrase"`.

</Expandable>
